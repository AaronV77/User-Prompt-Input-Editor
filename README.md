# User-Prompt-Input-Editor

This program is designed for people to take and implement it into their own application. The program is designed to display a prompt and take input from the user. What makes this program a diamond in the rough is that it allows you to edit the input before submitting to your application. So if you think of the user inferface of Bash, you have the tab (auto complete), up/down arrows for getting previous commands, and left/right arrows for moving the cursor left and right. This program does all this and works with the terminal to allow the user to edit the information, but I added other features to this program to use the home, end, and delete key as well. The home key will put the user at the beginning of the input, the end key will put the user at the end of the input, and the delete key will delete the whole section of input. I have put a lot of comments through the code, and commented out a lot of code that I don't think you would need if you were not programming a shell. There are special comments that will show you where to hook up your application to!
